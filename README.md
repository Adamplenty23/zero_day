#Markdowns

##This repo contains some demonstrations of some common markdows


- **HEADERS:**
   The "#" symbol is used for making a header. The smaller the #, the bigger the heading

- **EMPHASIS:**
   We use "*" or "-" to make emphasis on words eg
   a word written in-between "*" will italicised the words i.e *Adam* , if it is written between two asterisks"**" will make the words bold i.e **Adamplenty**

-**LINKS:**
   Links are created using the format ==> [text](links) eg [My_twitter_username](https://twitter.com/Adamplenty_01)
